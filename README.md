A very basic web Scraper that scrapes **https://myntra.com** at different views
to collect the product wise data located under that view.

A view is the 'URI(Unique resource identifier)' part of the website.

Example -> https://xyz.com/abc

Here, https://xyz.com is the URL (unique resource locator) while the /abc is the URI or view in this case.

Various views have already been stored in the constants. More can be added in the same format
 the other views constants are added in.
